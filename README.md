# Intro
This repository contains the code and data analysis scripts used in the study "Comparison of phage and plasmid populations in the gut microbiota between Parkinson's disease patients and controls." The analyses include alpha and beta diversity assessments, differential abundance analysis, and machine learning prediction models to compare gut microbiota between Parkinson's disease patients and control groups.
